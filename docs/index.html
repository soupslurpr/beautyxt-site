Doesn't require any permissions
</strong>

</summary>
  <p >
Unlike some other apps which might want access to all your files,
                                                        BeauTyXT uses the Android Storage Access Framework (SAF) to let you pick which file to open
                                                        without giving BeauTyXT access to all your files. BeauTyXT dosen't even have the INTERNET permission,
                                                        which apps need to directly make network connections.

                                                        and Markdown (.md & .markdown) files, it also has the option to open and edit files of any type as plain text.

                                                        on a file in a file manager, or opening a file sent by someone from a messaging app.

Export options
</strong>

</summary>
  <p >
BeauTyXT has export options for Plain Text (.txt & .text) and Markdown (.md & .markdown) files and Typst projects.  <br />
Plain Text (.txt & .text) files can be printed (including print to pdf), or exported to Office Open XML (.docx).  <br />
Markdown (.md & .markdown) files can be exported as HTML (.html) files.  <br />
Typst projects can be exported to PDF (.pdf) files.  <br />
  <br />
In addition, there is an experimental export Markdown (.md & .markdown) to Office Open XML (.docx) option which can
                                                                be enabled in the settings. Note that it does not support all features of Markdown
                                                                at this time and will be updated to support more. The setting description 
                                                                indicates the Markdown operations currently supported for conversion to Office Open XML (.docx).

Security against exploitation
</strong>

</summary>
  <p >
BeauTyXT has great security against exploitation (compared to most apps) as it runs its Rust code, which powers 
                                                        parsing Markdown, exporting to docx, and the Typst mode in an isolatedProcess service which runs in 
                                                        a separate process than the app. Each file or project's Rust library runs in its own separate process. It also renders the parsed Markdown (now HTML) in a WebView that has 
                                                        JavaScript disabled. For rendering the Typst project, it uses the Coil library written in Kotlin. However, 
                                                        it only renders an SVG generated by the Typst Rust code so the attack surface is minimized.
